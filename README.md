Head First C# - Lab#1 

This is the 1st Lab from the Head First C# workbook.

The project simulates a greyhound racing betting app. The bettors can bet between 5-15 money on one of 4 greyhounds (if they have enough money.) A visual representation of the race is then displayed, and after the race is over, if the bettor won, they double the money they bet, otherwise they lose the amount bet from their overall cash. Afterwards, the dogs are reset and the next roudn of betting can begin.
